    <h2>The Reality</h2>
    <body>A lot of students are interested in AI, but it can be hard to get started. We think the best way to learn is to focus on projects and building a passionate community.
       We want to connect students to mentors and empower individuals to utilize AI. We also challenge the notion that AI is a computer science 
      domain. It is easy to get intimidated by AI, but in reality, you only need basic programming knowledge and a passion!</body>
      <br><body>As programming becomes more universal, we believe having a multidisciplinary club
     can strengthen our culture and ideology. </body>
    <br><body>We work with AIRISE, external AI Clubs, and local student organisations.</body>
